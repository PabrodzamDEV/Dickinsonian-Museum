A django web project developed as my TFG (A final degree assignment) and inspired by my love of poetry, poets, art and Emily Dickinson in particular.
It is a site where users can post and see other poeple's poems, photographies, paintings, essays...

I tried to strike a balance between a comfy and calm aesthetic experience and the core features of a tiny social network using django's built-in tools while also including some custom features as well.
